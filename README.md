# Forest Ambient - Game Audio Exercise

This repository contains a short forest ambient loop that I created during a game audio class at my university (Collegium Da Vinci, 2nd semester).

The sound combines elements such as wind and subtle movement of branches to create a calm forest atmosphere that can be used as background audio in a game.

## Context

- Created as part of a **game audio** course.
- The goal was to design a looping ambient track for a forest environment.
- Prepared as a game-ready asset that can be used in an audio middleware project (FMOD).

## Files

- `forest_ambient_loop.m4a` - final rendered ambient loop.
- `fmod_forest_ambient.png` - screenshot from FMOD showing the event timeline and automation.

## Tools used

- **FMOD Studio** - event setup, volume automation and basic mixing.

## Possible use in a game

- Background ambient for:
  - forest levels,
  - outdoor scenes,
  - calm exploration areas.
- Can be looped and combined with other SFX (footsteps, UI sounds, etc.).
